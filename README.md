# LevelDB Parser (Master’s Thesis Project)

This is the early-stage repository for my Master’s thesis project, which involves developing a parser for LevelDB.


## Project Goal

The goal is to explore and understand the internal structure of LevelDB and implement a parser that can read and interpret LevelDB file formats. The tool may be useful in fields like:

- Digital forensics
- Database debugging
- Educational insight into LevelDB internals


## Status

**Work in progress!** – I’m curretly at the beginning of the implementation phase. So this repository will be continuously updated and changed as the thesis progresses.


## Planned Features

- [ ] parse `.ldb` files
- [ ] parse `.log` files
- [ ] parse `MANIFEST` files
- [ ] implement GUI with Tauri


## Thesis Info

This project is part of my Master’s thesis in *Digital forensics* at *Hochschule Albstadt-Sigmaringen*, Germany. The final thesis will be uploaded here once it’s submitted.
